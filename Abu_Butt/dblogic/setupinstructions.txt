To install MYSQL:
The instructions on the website are straightforward.

To install the JDBC bridge that allows Java to connect to MYSQL:
Go to https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
Save it to somewhere in your system
Add the location of the connector jar file to the classpath; in my case, on MAC, for example, my classpath is: 
.:/Users/username/mysql-connector-java-5.1.38/mysql-connector-java-5.1.38-bin.jar

This will allow Java to find the Java SQL connector.
