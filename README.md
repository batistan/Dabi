Install flask by running:

`pip install flask`

Install `pip` if you haven't since it's pretty useful anyway.

Go into the `flaskapp/` directory, run the command:

`python2 flask`

Go to http://localhost:5000/ (or http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your web browser and you'll get the index page. Alternatively, add a page e.g. http://localhost:5000/search\_results.html to go directly to it.

Remember your browser has a cache, so any changes you make while the server is up and running might not be immediately visible. For best results, refresh using CTRL-<F5> so the cache is ignored.
